# KeywordSpotting
Keyword Spotting with CNN for Game Control This project implements a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to detect voice keywords using MFCC features and data augmentation (e.g., background noise). The model is deployed to control a Snake game using voice commands. It runs on both desktop and Raspberry Pi devices.
